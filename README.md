# drumkit

Webpage hosting buttons allowing the user to play virtually on drum kit. The user can click on one of the seven buttons of the page or press on the corresponding keys on the keyboard to generate a sound. Each sound is different and particular to each different part of the drum kit.

Upon pressing on the buttons or pressing the appropriate keys on the keyboards the style of each button changes accordingly indicating clearly to the user which button is being pressed.

This project is hosted on Github Pages at the following address: https://emmanuel-mfum.github.io/drumkit/
